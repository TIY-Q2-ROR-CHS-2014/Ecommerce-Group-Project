This is the first group project done in The Iron Yard for our class. We chose to make an E-Commerce site for dresses.

Our website will contain an Admin section and a User section.

The Admin section will allow you to add images, a description, a title, and a price for the product.

The User section will display the products in a 3x3 grid of images, with a title and a price. The user can click on an image, which will pull up a description of the product.

The user's selections will be added to a shopping cart.
